## Problem Statement:
Predict the total number of views for a viral YouTube video to measure its success and provide creators with insights as to what features affect view count.

## Data Set: 
This dataset is about trending YouTube video statistics, which includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos
The original dataset includes 10 separate files for 10 regions. We will use the dataset file for the US region.
The data file is in CSV format and has an associated JSON file, which can be used to find the categories for a specific video by matching the unique category_id for the region.
The data file contains 40,950 rows and 16 columns, with features including data types such as string, number, boolean, time, ID, and URL. Example column names are video_id, trending_date, title, publish_time, comment_count, ratings_disabled, thumbnail_link, description and so on.
